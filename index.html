        Hey Angel…  
        I really hope you get better. I know life can feel so heavy sometimes. 
        I know there are days when everything feels like too much, when your heart 
        feels tired and your mind feels full of thoughts you don’t even want. 
        But please remember something important — you are not alone.

        I know life gets hard. I know sometimes it feels unfair. I know sometimes 
        you feel like giving up or just staying quiet because explaining your 
        feelings feels impossible. But I will stand here. I will stay here. 
        I won’t walk away when things get difficult. I won’t disappear when 
        you feel low.

        You are stronger than you think. Even when you feel weak, you are still 
        fighting. Even when you feel broken, you are still beautiful. Even when 
        you feel tired, you are still trying — and that matters more than you know.

        I hope your heart finds peace. I hope your mind finds rest. I hope the 
        days ahead become softer and lighter for you. And until that happens, 
        I will stand here beside you, supporting you, caring for you, believing 
        in you even when you don’t believe in yourself.

        You mean more than you realize. And no matter how hard life gets, 
        I am not going anywhere.
        </p>

        <button onclick="nextPage(event)">Next Page ➡</button>
    </div>

    <div class="page" id="page2">
        <p>
        And if today feels overwhelming, just breathe. Take one small step at a time. 
        You don’t have to solve everything today. You don’t have to be perfect. 
        You just have to keep going.

        I hope you heal from the things you don’t talk about. I hope you smile 
        again without forcing it. I hope you wake up one day and feel lighter 
        than you did before. 

        No matter how dark it feels, there is still light in you. 
        And I will always remind you of that.

        Get better, Angel. Slowly. Gently. At your own pace.
        I’m right here. Always.
        </p>
